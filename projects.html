<ul>
<li><p><b>Deep Q-Learning based PC Game</b> (<i>Course Project: Neural Networks</i>) [Spring 2017]<br />
<i>Mentor- Prof. Laxmidhar Behera, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i><b>Objective: </b>Control a car in a PC game using reinforcement learning such that the car collects as many coins as possible and avoids as many obstacles possible.</i>	 <br/>	  
<i><b>Algorithm: </b>Collected the frame from the game and was fed to a CNN for object identification, followed by an Actor network which gave the next move to be played and was provided with the feedback mechanism of Q-Learning. Feedback consisted of both penalty and reward.</i>	 <br/>
<i><b> Result: </b>The car showed excellent performance in both avoiding obstacles and collecting coins.</i>	 <br/>

<li><p><b>Zero Shot Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</b> (<i>Course Project: Machine Learning</i>) [Fall 2016]<br />
<i>Mentor-  Prof. Piyush Rai, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i>Zero Shot Learning is about recognizing new categories of instances without training examples, by providing a high level description of the new categories that relate them to categories previously learned by the machine.</i> <br/>	  
<i>Studied and implemented some recent works in the field and in particular different approaches to solve the problem like Zero-Shot learning with semantic output or cross modal transfer.</i>	 <br/>
<i>Used two datasets: fMRI and aPascal &amp aYahoo Datasets and processed the data according to our requirements.</i>	 <br/></p>

<li><p><b>Application of NEAT algorithm in PC Games</b> (<i>Course Project: Artificial Intelligence Programming</i>) [Spring 2016]<br />
<i>Mentor-  Prof. Harish Karnick, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i>A 2-D artificially intelligent computer game was made using python in which 2 robots learnt to fight each other starting from a random fight to a highly skilled fight, over several generation of their evolution.</i><br/>	  
<i>The learning task was based on the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, using an evolving neural network with the final generation (∼ 100th) of networks having about 5 hidden layers.</i>	 <br/>

<li><p><b>Text Compression Using Lexicographic Permutation of Binary Strings</b></i> [Fall 2015]<br />
<i>Mentor-  Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i> A novel text compression algorithm was developed based on concepts from combinatorics and also relative frequency of letters in text files.</i> <br/>	  
<i>The proposed algorithm used the Unique Lexicographic Rank (ULR) of the message which when tested on Calgary and Project Gutenberg corpus could achieve compression ratio as low as 0:53 using a trigram model encoder.</i>	 <br/>

<li><p><b>Multi Character Frequency based Encoding for Efficient Text Messaging in Indian Languages</b></i> [SUMMER 2015]<br />
<i>Mentor-  Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i>The motivation of the project was to develop efficient compression algorithm for text files in Indian languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Hindi and Tamil.</i> <br/>	  
<i>A bi-gram algorithm was introduced for the same which showed better compression ratio than the existing Table marker algorithm when the probability factor was greater than 2/3 , and it was verified that this was the case in real life examples with high probability.</i>	 <br/>

<li><p><b>Recognition of Facial Speech Gestures</b></i> [FALL 2014]<br />
<i>Mentor-  Prof. A.R. Harish, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i>Developed a device that recorded the variation in face muscle potential of the user, using which it could detect the the sounds that were produced by the user while conversing.</i> <br/>	  
<i>The device was capable of recognizing the syllables ’a’ and ’e’ correctly in 6 out of 8 cases. This device may find use in applications such as silent speech or facial gesture recognition.</i>	 <br/>
<i>The project was ranked among the top 10 projects across all the IITs in Ericsson Innovation Award 2014-2015 and was awarded with a fund of Rs. 25000 for prototype development.</i>	 <br/>

<li><p><b>Sleep and Fitness Tracker</b></i> [SUMMER 2014]<br />
<i>Electronics club, IIT Kanpur</i><br />               	    
<i>A device consisting of an accelerometer and a bluetooth antenna was made to track the 3-D motion of the user and send it via bluetooth to any connected android device, using an android app that was also developed.<br/>	  
<i>The data sent to the android device was used to analyse the performance of physical activities by the user such as walking, running, jogging or jumping</i>	 <br/>
<i>The device could also be worn by the user during sleep in which case it gives an analysis of deep and light sleep and also uses a smart alarm to wake up the user after optimum amount of deep and light sleep.</i>	 <br/>
